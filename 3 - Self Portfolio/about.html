              <h3>About Me</h3>

              <p>My name is Dayrl Hern and I am a problem solver.</p>
              
              <p>My combined interests, skills, and experience help me see unique solutions and solve difficult problems. After 20 years of maintaining and managing public safety communications and IT systems, I have decided to give back in a different way.</p>
              <p>According to the Small Business Association, small and medium size businesses (SME's) make up 99.9% of U.S. businesses and account for 47.1% of the U.S. workforce. During the pandemic, they have been hit hard and many have had to close their doors. Many more struggle to keep up with inflation, mandated expenses, and shortages of product and labor. I feel that SMEs are the backbone of America and I want to support that backbone and keep our communities and country strong.</p>
              <p>I founded Cynoid Systems LLC, a technology consulting firm specializing in helping small and medium size businesses with their technology needs.</p>
              <p>Most small businesses do not have the budget to employ experienced tech staff full-time. The result is that most of their technology solutions come from internet research, or from a friend/employee that has some IT knowledge. While this can lead to solutions that may work in the short-term, it may also leave you vulnerable to security risks and may have you asking a few questions down the road. My goal is to help businesses overcome the difficulty of choosing and integrating solutions that help their businesses thrive.</p>
