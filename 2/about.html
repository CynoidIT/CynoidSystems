          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>We specialize in small and medium size businesses, to help implement secure and reliable technologies that support your operations and allow you to focus on the growth of your business.</p>

        <section id="whyUs">
          <h3>Why Us?</h3>
          <p>Most small businesses do not have the budget to employ experienced tech staff full-time. The result is that most of their technology solutions come from internet research, or from a friend/employee that has some IT knowledge. While this can lead to solutions that may work in the short-term, it may also leave you vulnerable to security risks and may have you asking a few questions down the road.</p>
          <p>We offer expert knowledge on a wide range of technologies that can help answer these types of questions and many more. As your Technology Partner, we offer "as-needed", "per-job", or "on-contract" pricing packages that can be customized to fit the needs of your business.</p>
          <p>Our services are not just limited to businesses. Our team can assist with any technology related issue you may have and offer advice about new solutions you may want to implement. If it's technology related, we are confident we can help. No job is too big, or too small!</p>
